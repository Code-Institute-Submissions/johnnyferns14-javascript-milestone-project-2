### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   Due to the limit of info in the api, the users will have to enter the IATA codes instead of place name and currency code in caps. 
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   Due to limited functionality of the api, the user will need to enter the IATA code or Country Code in the From & To inputs and the currency code (in caps) in the currency input. Please refer to this [website](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm) for the list of country codes.
- The api shows only direct flights between major airports of the world.
